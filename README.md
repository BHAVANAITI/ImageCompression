K-means colour clustering Algorithm:


1.In our problem of image compression, K-means clustering will group similar colors together into ‘k’ clusters 
of different colors (RGB values).

2.Therefore, each cluster centroid is the representative of the three dimensional color vector 
in RGB color space of its respective cluster.

3.Now, these ‘k’ cluster centroids will replace all the color vectors in their respective clusters. 
Thus, we need to only store the label for each pixel which tells the cluster to which this pixel belongs.

4.Additionally, we keep the record of color vectors of each cluster center.
